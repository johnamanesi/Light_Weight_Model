In this study, we introduced a Lightweight CNN model, a convolutional neural network designed for efficiency and performance. The model employs the IRShuffleUnit, a custom-designed block that optimizes computational load and memory usage by carefully balancing the number of parameters and the complexity of operations. The Lightweight CNN model offers a compelling blend of high performance and computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Achieving an accuracy of 96.67% and an F1-score of 0.9665, it performs on par with leading models such as ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2. Notably, the model operates with approximately 1.2 x 108 floating-point operations (FLOPs) per image, representing an 88% reduction compared to ResNet-50 1 x 109 FLOPs and a 40% reduction compared to MobileNetV2 2 x 108 FLOPs. This substantial decrease in computational load is complemented by its compact size of 22.96 MB and a parameter count of 530,928, which is significantly lower than that of ResNet-50 and VGG16 but slightly higher than MobileNetV2.
In practical terms, the modelâ€™s efficiency extends to its operational speed, with an inference time of 0.014515 seconds per image and a latency of 0.023119 seconds. These metrics surpass those of ResNet-50 and VGG16 and are competitive with MobileNetV2, ensuring rapid and responsive performance. Overall, the Lightweight CNN model is well-suited for deployment on devices with limited computational resources, such as mobile phones and embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi, which typically have lower RAM (e.g., 1 GB to 4 GB) and less powerful processors (e.g., ARM Cortex-A series). Its balance of high accuracy, low FLOPs, and fast processing times makes it an excellent choice for real-time applications where computational efficiency is critical.
